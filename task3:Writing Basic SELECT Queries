***Example Database***
Imagine we have two tables:

***customers***

customer_id     	name     	city     	    age
1	                Alice	    Hyderabad	    28
2	                Bob	      Delhi	        35
3	                Charlie	  Mumbai	      42
4	                Diana	    Hyderabad	    30

***orders***

order_id	   customer_id	   product    	amount   	order_date
101	         1	             Laptop	      75000	    2025-09-01
102	         2	             Phone	      25000	    2025-09-05
103	         1	             Headphones	  5000	    2025-09-10
104	         3	             Tablet	      30000	    2025-09-12


***SQL Script***
sql
-- 1. Select all columns from customers
SELECT * 
FROM customers;
-- 2. Select specific columns
SELECT name, city 
FROM customers;
-- 3. Filter with WHERE
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Hyderabad';
-- 4. Use AND / OR
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Hyderabad' AND age > 25;
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE city = 'Delhi' OR city = 'Mumbai';
-- 5. Pattern matching with LIKE
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';   -- names starting with A
-- 6. Range filtering with BETWEEN
SELECT * 
FROM customers
WHERE age BETWEEN 30 AND 40;
-- 7. Sorting results with ORDER BY
SELECT * 
FROM orders
ORDER BY amount DESC;
-- 8. Limit the number of results
SELECT * 
FROM orders
ORDER BY order_date DESC
LIMIT 2;
-- 9. Join two tables (customers + orders)
SELECT c.name, o.product, o.amount
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.amount > 20000
ORDER BY o.amount DESC;

***Outcome***

Sort results with ORDER BY.
Restrict rows with LIMIT.
Combine data from multiple tables with JOIN.
This script gives you a clear understanding of SQL basics and how to query relational databases effectively.
